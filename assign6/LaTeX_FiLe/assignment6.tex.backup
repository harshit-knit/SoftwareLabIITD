\chapter{\textcolor{blue}{\underline {PROBLEM STATEMENT}}}

Problem (Compulsory - 100 marks, difficulty level: *)
 \begin{enumerate}
\item There are N packets, each with one or more candies. There are K students among 
which the packets have to be distributed. (Assume K<N for all cases). The 
parameters N and K have to be provided by the user at run-time. Each student 
gets only one packet. The number of candies in various packets are 
(x1, x2, x3,....xk ) , where xi denotes the number of candies in the ith packet.
Find the number of triplets (x1, x2, x3) possible such that sum of the candies 
(x1 + x2 + x3) is even.\\



\item Optional bonus problems:
These following problems are optional and represent higher levels of difficulty
(proportional to the number of stars **). Bonus marks (indicated against each) 
will be given for attempting these.
Let unfairness be defined.



\item Divide the packets of candies among the K students such that u is minimum
(***/10 points) Problem O2 : Divide the packets into two parts (p1 and p2) such
that the difference(|p1-p2|) is minimum, where p1 and p2 are the total number of 
candies in part 1 and part 2 respectively.
\end{enumerate}

\chapter{\textcolor{blue}{\underline {ABSTRACT}}}
\end{center}
\noindent The Intention of the C++ Code is to make use of the Dynamic Programming to evalute Triplets which has even no of 
candies in the packet. In the second part we have to calculate the minimum unfairness among the packet of candies that is
to be distributed between K no of student fairly. And in the third part we have to divide the packets into two parts (p1 and p2) such that
the difference(|p1-p2|) is minimum, where p1 and p2 are the total number of candies in
part 1 and part 2 respectively.

\chapter{\textcolor{blue}{\underline {INTRODUCTION}}}
\end{center}
\noindent C++ (pronounced see plus plus) is a programming language that is general purpose, statically typed, free-form, multi-paradigm and compiled. It is regarded as an intermediate-level language, as it comprises both high-level and low-level language features. Developed by Bjarne Stroustrup starting in 1979 at Bell Labs, C++ was originally named C with Classes, adding object-oriented features, such as classes, and other enhancements to the C programming language. The language was renamed C++ in 1983, as a pun involving the increment operator.

C++ is one of the most popular programming languages and is implemented on a wide variety of hardware and operating system platforms. As an efficient compiler to native code, its application domains include systems software, application software, device drivers, embedded software, high-performance server and client applications, and entertainment software such as video games. Several groups provide both free and proprietary C++ compiler software, including the GNU Project, LLVM, Microsoft and Intel. C++ has greatly influenced many other popular programming languages, most notably C and Java.

In computer science, dynamic programming is a method for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems. It is applicable to problems exhibiting the properties of overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure (described below). When applicable, the method takes far less time than naive methods that don't take advantage of the subproblem overlap (like depth-first search).

\end{center}
\section*{Specifications}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Different Functions have been used for different obzectives.
\item show function is used to display the books available
\item book Edition has been acted as a unique value with the book name to identify a book
\item student privileges are only limited to view and add books.
\item admin , faculty login can delete the books as required.
\item atoi function has been invoked from stdlib Library.

\end{enumerate}

\section*{Assumptions}

\begin{enumerate}
\item There are as such no multiple copies of a book for same edition.
\item The author name and other such variables accept character Values only.
\item Error handling has been done accordingly for non existent books or as such .

\end{enumerate}
 
\begin{center}
\chapter{\textcolor{blue}{\underline {LOGIC USED/METHODOLOGY}}}
\end{center}
The methodology that is used for developing the program is defined below:\\

\begin{enumerate}
\item Basically , We intiate our code in C++ with the switch case command.
\item They avail the user to use as many options they can exercise.
\item The values of the Book attributes are saved in Character only.
\item We simply create functions for all the options.
\item The class obzect of the bookk is invoked by the class instance.
\item The values are recorded intoo a file system.
\item further Searching of the values done from the file named file.txt
\item Records may be deleted added as per specification.

\end{enumerate}
